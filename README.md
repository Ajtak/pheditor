Pheditor
=======

Pheditor is a single-file editor for PHP with syntax highlighting feature.



### Install & Usage

Install using composer:
`composer require hamidsamak/pheditor dev-master`

or just upload `pheditor.php` to your web host (and/or rename it as you wish).

**NOTES**:
1. The default password is `admin`. Please change the password after login.
2. As the script gives permission to edit files, it is recommended to keep the address private or protect that with `.htpasswd` in Apache web-server.
